A Professional Template for Building and Deploying Agent-Based AI SystemsThis project is an example of a production-grade AI assistant using agentic architecture.

It demonstrates how to structure a real-world AI system with modular components, API deployment, configuration management, and agent-based logic.

---

## 📌 What This Repo Is

This is a **production-grade AI project skeleton** designed for modern, real-world projects involving:

* LLM-based reasoning
* Tool-using agents
* REST API integration
* Environment-driven configuration
* Scalable and testable architecture

This project is useful for:

* AI/ML engineers building agentic assistants
* Students looking to learn from real structure
* Companies bootstrapping internal tools or assistants
* Job applicants showing off real project architecture

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Modular AI agents
- REST API (FastAPI)
- Prompt-based planning system
- Docker-ready
- Config-driven (Pydantic + YAML)
- Easily testable and extendable

## 🧱 Project Architecture Overview

```bash
├── main.py              # CLI entrypoint to run agent
├── api/                 # Versioned REST API (FastAPI)
├── src/                 # Core agent, model, and logic modules
├── config/              # Prompts, settings, keys, and thresholds
├── data/                # Raw and processed sample data
├── tests/               # Unit + integration tests
├── postman/             # Optional: API testing collections
├── walkthrough/         # This document and supporting diagrams
```

This structure separates concerns cleanly:

✅ **API** for interaction

✅ **Agent logic** for reasoning

✅ **Config** for modular reuse

✅ **Testing** for robustness

## 🔧 Key Components Explained

### `main.py`

Runs the agent in CLI mode. Ideal for local dev or batch workflows without using the API.

---

### `api/v1/`

A versioned FastAPI setup with:

* `router.py`: Defines REST routes like `/plan`, `/answer`, etc.
* `service.py`: Logic that lives behind the route — fetches data, calls agents.
* `schemas/`: Pydantic models to validate requests and structure responses.

This lets your agent be used as a microservice with live tools.

---

### `src/`

Where the core logic lives:

* `agents/planner_agent.py`: Your main agent loop or orchestration engine
* `tools.py`: External tools or custom functions the agent can call
* `llm/openai_interface.py`: Simple interface for LLMs (GPT, Claude, etc.)
* `pipeline/`: Optional ETL-style data pipelines
* `model/fine_tune.py`: Custom training if needed
* `utils/`: Shared helpers

---

### `config/`

Your project’s brain — controls behavior without touching code:

* `settings.py`: Pydantic-powered settings loaded from `.env`
* `prompts/`: Modular prompt templates
* `apis/endpoints.yaml`: Declarative service definitions
* `thresholds.yaml`: Tunable knobs (e.g. confidence cutoffs)

This enables reuse across environments.

---

### `tests/`

Contains real unit and integration tests, organized to parallel the `src/` structure.
Includes `conftest.py` for reusable fixtures or setup logic.

---

### `postman/`

Includes a Postman collection file to test your API routes with example inputs.

---

## 🔁 How to Customize This Repo

### 1. Use as a starting point

* Clone the repo and update the README
* Rename `planner_agent.py` to reflect your agent
* Replace `planner_prompt.txt` with your own task

### 2. Adjust for different styles:

| Style              | How to Modify                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Research notebook  | Use only `main.py`+`src/agents/`, skip API |
| Multi-agent system | Add `agents/agent_2.py`, expand tools        |
| Real-time API      | Extend `router.py`, add database or webhook  |
| Data project       | Focus on `pipeline/`and `model/`folders    |

## 🧠 Best Practices Embedded in This Repo

* Pydantic settings for clean config
* Versioned API routes for future upgrades
* Prompt templates stored outside of code
* Fast setup with `Makefile` and `.env.example`
* Clear modular folder structure
* Testing-first mindset

---

## 🧪 Getting Started

```bash
make run   # Run agent via CLI
make api   # Launch API (FastAPI with auto-reload)
make test  # Run unit tests

```

Or manually:

```bash
uvicorn api.v1.router:app --reload
```
